> ***Clean, Organized and Secure Code builds a better and reliable product***  


\
Create a React App from a boilerplate with minimalistic packages and reduce the vulnerabilities from unsecure and unmaintained packages.   


# Getting Started  

- `npx create-react-app-v2 <your-app-name>`
	- Creates an app folder `your-app-name`  


- `cd your-app-name`


- `npm start` 
	- It will start a `localhost` server at port 3000.  


## For production

- `npm run build`  


## Configuration  

- Modify `webpack` files to meet with your project needs  

`webpack.config` for local or primary development.  

`webpack.prod` for production related config.
